## Icq\-SMS


</div>

### Description

You can send sms messages to mobile phones thru Icq Server without having to open a webbrowser or internet browser. It works perfectly.

This code is an upgrade to some code i've seen on the PSC, but now it doesn't works becase the guys from icq changed their system. My way it works. At least until they change again ! :)
